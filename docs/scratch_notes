HIGH PRIORITY:
__________________
- Fix 404 error when you unfollow
- should remove 'name likes this' when unliking, and add when liking
- Refactor some code in post_index_item.jst.ejs - big check around it is no good - prob multiple views
  - move grid photos into into a grid photo index view

LATER:
__________________
gravatar - prof pics
- Liking
  - add validation that user can only like a post one time
  - Make it so you can't like while it is running the process (e.g., ajax twitter)
  - check edge case of liking from names to number
- handle image cropping
- potenitally add validation to image.rb
- Write User Edit File
- prevent anyone from editing a user profile by going to the url (e.g., redirect unless logged in)
- add delete button for your comments
- potentially remove current user id from window
- When you go to a route (e.g., upload, make it active on nav)


ASK ABOUT:
__________________

- Caching info so it doesn't have to query for every comment, username
- Help with getting heroku working


- Popover bootstrap (getting more detail to come up) - grid_photo.js
    - gridphoto.jst.ejs: <%= post.escape("num_likes") %>,  <%= post.escape("num_comments") %>
- CSS on the form page for users/new - how to get form to space off top

View Structure

Post Index - nothing

CommentIndex - subview / CompositeView
Comment Item - view

Post Show - CompositeView
header area view - view
Grid - view

Steps to create an image
  - show image - how can I do cropping?
  - Save a version of the image
  - create a userUpload route and a view
  - view will grab last image(from url in string) and display thumbnails of all filters
  - Make the url reference for each filter based on the dynamic part.
  - Have a form to add a caption and location.
  - Submit the form with the url of the active image.
  - create a post that belongs to the image
  - Re-render the index
