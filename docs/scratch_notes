HIGH PRIORITY:
__________________
-Edit: make edit page backbone
-Notifications
  -Should be created when - liking, commenting or following happens [need to make null true for post id on following]
  -Should not happen if you like or comment on your own stuff
  -Should be limited to your last 3 notifications
  -Should be a different color if read
  -handle clicking on it - potentially make it not clickable
  -how to handle not creating similar notifications for the same username, body and post

Notification - how to get longer text to wrap

-Modal Background CSS
-Create a home page / log in tour
-Set timer: someone likes your photo 10 seconds after login

PanToPost when created

Geocomplete - handle errors from that (e.g. someone puts in nonsense) - how to put in errors div

LATER:
__________________
- Make Info Window on map better
-Potentially allow people to turn panning off
- Edge Cases
  - Tall Image: stretches it
  - Small Image: ?
- handle image cropping?
- prevent anyone from editing a user profile by going to the url (e.g., redirect unless logged in)
- add delete button for your comments
- potentially remove current user id from window
- When you go to a route (e.g., upload, make it active on nav)
- Make feed only for people you are subscribed to?
- Check in on Heroku

ASK ABOUT:
__________________
- Maps
  - can you make image clickable to scroll to it? / show modal?
- Speed / Caching info so it doesn't have to query for every comment, username

Clean up
__________________
- potenitally add validation to image.rb
Make schema.md reflect actual database
Clean up routes file
files to delete that may be making folder overweight
Remove login details
Remove store images on rails
Add below to set-up/readme
Fix links on readme
- add validation that user can only like a post one time at model level?
  - check edge case of liking from names to number
- cleaner center on grid photo hover
-potentially different reaction for posts without location. Not super important as all seed data will have a location

Steps to create an image
  - show image - how can I do cropping?
  - Save a version of the image
  - create a userUpload route and a view
  - view will grab last image(from url in string) and display thumbnails of all filters
  - Make the url reference for each filter based on the dynamic part.
  - Have a form to add a caption and location.
  - Submit the form with the url of the active image.
  - create a post that belongs to the image
  - Re-render the index
