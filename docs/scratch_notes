Steps to create an image
  - show image - how can I do cropping?
  - Save a version of the image
  - create a userUpload route and a view
  - view will grab last image(from url in string) and display thumbnails of all filters
  - Make the url reference for each filter based on the dynamic part.
  - Have a form to add a caption and location.
  - Submit the form with the url of the active image.
  - create a post that belongs to the image
  - Re-render the index
