HIGH PRIORITY:
__________________
-Notifications
  -Should be created when - liking, commenting or following happens
  -Should not happen if you like or comment on your own stuff
-Location Input
  -Read up on geocoder for location input

-Modal Background CSS
-Create a home page / log in tour
-potentially different reaction for posts without location. Not super important as all seed data will have a location
-Set timer: someone likes your photo 10 seconds after login

Steps to create an image
  - show image - how can I do cropping?
  - Save a version of the image
  - create a userUpload route and a view
  - view will grab last image(from url in string) and display thumbnails of all filters
  - Make the url reference for each filter based on the dynamic part.
  - Have a form to add a caption and location.
  - Submit the form with the url of the active image.
  - create a post that belongs to the image
  - Re-render the index
